# Operating Range Summary (ORS) Conversion Project

This project focuses on converting older MATLAB-based  code into Python. The goal is to modernize the codebase, improve maintainability, and leverage Python's extensive ecosystem for data processing and analysis.

## Features

- Converts MATLAB scripts to Python for DLS, Track and Voyager data processing.
- Processes and analyses data, including setup extraction and corner phase analysis.
- Outputs data in efficient formats like Parquet for further analysis and plotting.
- Modular Python scripts designed for extensibility and clarity.
